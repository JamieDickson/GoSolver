The Gui is simple and intuitive to use.
Below is a list of notes that are important for a new user to understand to facilitate use of the software. 

 

The Gui version requires that the Next Move button be clicked after every move, this can be frustrating for new users. 

If player 1 is set as an ai player in the Gui version a loaded board will not appear until their move is calculated.   

If the board is high in difficulty and the ai takes a while to solve it then the user could be left looking at an empty board for a long time. 

The program will be unresponsive while the algorithm is calculating, this can lead to a user needing to end the task when wanting to abort a long running high difficulty problem.
